The Lightroom to iPhoto plugin exports the selected photos from Adobe Lightroom to iPhoto and creates an album with the exported photos if needed.

Why would one like to duplicate photos from Lightroom in iPhoto? Well, Lightroom is my main photo repository but I miss the tight integration with Mac OS X like iPhoto has. iPhoto makes it easy to browse your photo library from different applications (like Finder and Mail) or export the photos to external devices (like the iPhone, iPod or iPad), Ligthroom doesn't.
